<h1> Impact Driven </h1>  

</section>

 <section class="content">




 

<p> The average price based algorithm , namely TWAP and VWAP, represent the first generation of impact-driven algorithms. </p>

<p> These algorithms aim to reduce the effect that buynig/ or selling an stock has on the traded securitys price. </p>

<p> Remember :   Buying a large quantity of one stock signals an increase in the demand for the stock. An increase in the demand means that sellers can raise the price. </p>


<p> And Vice Versa ! </p>

<p> These Algorithms aim to hide the effect of buying or selling large quantities of stock has on the assests price by hiding the purchase over a certain time frame. </p>
