<h1>Percentage of Volume Algorithm . </h1>  

</section>

 <section class="content">



<p>The Time Weighted Average Price Algorithm is a natural extension of early order-slicing based trading strategies. By splitting larger orders into smaller, multiple child orders, traders try and reduce the effect that buying a stock will have on the stocks price.</p>

 Remember :  <p> Buying a large quantity of one stock will increase the demand it , and subsequently push up the price. </p>

<p> The average price based algorithm , namely TWAP and VWAP represent the first generation of impact-driven algorithms. These algorithms are 
schedule based algorithms. They do not respond to changes in stock they are monitorings price or volume . There aim is to completely execute the order within the given timeframe, acoring to the parameters they are given , irrespective of other market conditions</p>
