ebean is an easy to use ORM. 

"Ebean is a Java ORM library that aims to implement a very simple interface to mapping Java objects to the database. It uses JPA annotations for mapping classes to tables, but if you have had experience with JPA before, Ebean differs in that it is sessionless. This can greatly simplify the way you interact with the database, removing many of the surprises of things being done at odd times, such as session flushing, and errors with regards to stale or detached objects that can occur when using JPA"
